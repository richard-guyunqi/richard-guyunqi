### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Richard Gu!

Hi! I am Richard, a passionate AI engineer studying math and computer science at Stanford University. I have been working at Stanford Artifitial Intelligence Lab for ML research, from which I gained a strong knowledgebase of a variety of models, ranging from CV, GNN, to NLP. At Alibaba Cloud, I focused on the application side and collaborated with my team to develop a data visualization auto-arrangement tool. I deeply believe that the combination of the two opens up countless possibilities for the future. Besides that, I play soccer and chess!
