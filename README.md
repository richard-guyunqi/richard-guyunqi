### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Richard Gu!

Hi! It's Richard here. I'm currently studying math and computer science(with focus on machine learning) at Stanford. I have been working at Stanford Artifitial Intelligence Lab and Alibaba Cloud for ML works. I deeply believe that the combination of the two opens up countless possibilities for the future. Besides that, I play soccer and chess!
